# Todo
This library is still work in progress, and misses some valuable features:

- Introduction of `#[Deprecated]` attribute
- ~~Overwrite type via attributes~~
- Allow simple lists (array type)
- Connection, edge, nodes (see https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm)
- Make AST serializable (cacheable)
- Handle `DateTime` and `DateTimeImmutable`
- GraphQL interfaces, inheritance
- Inject autowiring services
- Subscriptions
