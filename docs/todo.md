# Todo
This library is still work in progress, and misses some valuable features:

- ~~Introduction of `#[Deprecated]` attribute~~
- ~~Overwrite type via attributes~~
- ~~Allow simple lists (array type)~~
- ~~Make AST serializable (cacheable)~~
- Connection, edge, nodes (see https://relay.dev/graphql/connections.htm)
- Handle `DateTime` and `DateTimeImmutable`
- GraphQL interfaces, inheritance
- Inject autowiring services
- Subscriptions
