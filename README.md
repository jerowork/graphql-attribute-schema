Easily build your GraphQL schema for [webonyx/graphql-php](https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php) using **PHP attributes** instead of large configuration arrays.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** This library is still a work in progress. Check out the [TODO list](docs/todo.md) for details.

## Why use this library?

The [webonyx/graphql-php](https://github.com/webonyx/graphql-php) package requires a **schema** to run a GraphQL server. Normally, this schema is defined using large and complex PHP arrays, making it harder to manage and maintain.

Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if there was a **simpler, more structured way** to define your schema?

That‚Äôs exactly what **GraphQL Attribute Schema** does! üöÄ

By adding attributes (`#[Mutation]`, `#[Query]`, `#[Type]`, etc.) directly to your classes, this library **automatically generates** the GraphQL schema for you; **cleaner, faster, and easier to maintain**.
